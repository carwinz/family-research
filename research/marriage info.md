specific to Prussia etc

Firstly, a lot of German-speaking states at the time required both a civil and religious ceremony. And those weren't always on the same date.


Secondly, some states had restrictions on marriage or required approval. The gist seems to be that they wanted to slow down the birth of poor people because infant mortality had dropped, machines were taking jobs, etc. You couldn't marry before you were 25 years old in some places. In other places, you had to demonstrate that you had the financial means to support a child. Proclamation was also part of the requirements in some places.

Of course the end result (even amongst Lutherans it seems) was that people had kids prior to getting married.
