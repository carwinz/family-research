This is some family history research into the Zimmermann family that left Prussia in 1871 to settle in South East Queensland.

The research currently focuses on [Ernst Zimmermann](./people/1841-1928%20Ernst%20August%20Friedrich%20Wilhelm%20Zimmermann.md) who should not be confused with ["Stettin" Ernst](./people/1831%20Stettin%20Ernst.md) or ["Western" Ernst](./people/1841%20Western%20Ernst.md).

We'd really like to know more about [his father](./people/Christ%20Zimmermann%2C%20Ernst's%20dad.md)
