“Weiland” means “sometime, formerly, erstwhile” and is abbreviated “weil.” It is used here as a synonym for “late” or “deceased.”


The next word is “Arbeiter” (worker). Thus, “weiland Arbeiter Christ. Zimmermann in Schenkenberg.”

Also, you may already have this, but the groom is a “Knecht” (servant) and his father-in-law, “Maurer und Eigenthümer” (bricklayer/mason and owner/proprietor).
