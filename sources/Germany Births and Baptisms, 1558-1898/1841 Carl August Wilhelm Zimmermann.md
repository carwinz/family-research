## Why this could be Ernst

Very close dates to family records. Fairly close match on the name. Would be good to double check that "Carl" is not a misread of "Ernst".

see also wikipedia matches for "Wilhelm Zimmermann"

## Why not

Stettin matches places for the birth of 3 children of "Stettin" Ernst. However, that would mean that the age on Stettin Ernst' marriage certificate is out by 10 years. And if it is out by 10 years, then maybe they are one and the same person.
