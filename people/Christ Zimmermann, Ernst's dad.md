In church records of Ernst's marriage, he is called `weiland Arbeiter Christ. Zimmermann in Schenkenberg.` Weiland meaning deceased; Arbeiter means worker. [See](../sources/Germany,%20Prussia,%20Brandenburg%20and%20Posen,%20Church%20Book%20Duplicates,%201794-1874/1868%20August%20Friedrich%20Wilhelm%20Zimmermann%20marriage.md)


In [other church records](../sources/Germany,%20Lutheran%20Baptisms,%20Marriages,%20and%20Burials,%201500-1971/1869%20Ernst%20and%20Wilhelmine%20marriage.md) he is  `Christian Zimmermann in schenkenberg`

Perhaps schenkenberg refers to "Groß Schenkenberg", a municipality in the district of Herzogtum Lauenburg in Schleswig-Holstein, southwest of Lübeck?
