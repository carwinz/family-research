## Summary

Ernst is the oldest known relative of the Zimmermann family who migrated from Germany to Queensland in 1871.

Not much is certain about his early years. He may have had 3 children with Emilie Baumert/Baumann when he was 18-22 years old. Note that this is not mentioned in family records, but it's probably not something religious people of those times would have been proud of either!?

He was married in 1868 to Wilhelmine Christine Schulz. They had two daughters, Auguste and Anna, but Auguste died young.

In 1871, the family of three took a four month voyage to Queensland on the "Herschel". One of Ernst's sister-in-laws had previously migrated, two more migrated with them, and the rest of the family followed in later years.

The family lived in the Brisbane area before taking up farming first near Lowood and then near Englesburg (now Kalbar).

Ernst and Wilhelmine went on to have 7 more children. Ernst died in 1928.

## Name

In his later years, he was referred to as "Ernst Zimmermann", but there was a fair amount of variation across different records

A possible [christening record](../sources/Germany%20Births%20and%20Baptisms,%201558-1898/1841%20Carl%20August%20Wilhelm%20Zimmermann.md) lists his name as `Carl August Wilhelm Zimmermann`.

In another possible match, birth and baptismal records lists him as `Ernst August Friedrich Zimmermann`, the father of [Christiane Auguste Marie Zimmermann](../sources/Germany%20Births%20and%20Baptisms,%201558-1898/1859%20Christiane%20Auguste%20Marie%20Zimmermann.md) and [Martha Emilie Ottilie Zimmermann](../sources/Germany%20Births%20and%20Baptisms,%201558-1898/1861%20Martha%20Emilie%20Ottilie%20Zimmermann.md). He was called `Ernst Zimmermann` two years later at the christening of his son [Richard Carl Ernst Zimmermann](../sources/Germany%20Births%20and%20Baptisms,%201558-1898/1863%20Richard%20Carl%20Ernst%20Zimmermann.md)

Another possible [christening record](../sources/Germany%20Births%20and%20Baptisms,%201558-1898/1841%20Friedrich%20Carl%20Conrad%20Zimmermann.md) has a name of `Friedrich Carl Conrad Zimmermann` on 18 May 1841. 

When he was married in 1868, [church records](../sources/Germany,%20Prussia,%20Brandenburg%20and%20Posen,%20Church%20Book%20Duplicates,%201794-1874/1868%20August%20Friedrich%20Wilhelm%20Zimmermann%20marriage.md) called him `August Friedrich Wilhelm Zimmermann`, but [German marriage records](../sources/Germany%20Marriages,%201558-1929/1868%20August%20Friedrich%20Zimmermann%20marriage.md) called him `August Friedrich Zimmermann`.

He is called `Ernst Zimmermann`:

* In 1869, at the [baptism](../sources/Germany,%20Prussia,%20Brandenburg%20and%20Posen,%20Church%20Book%20Duplicates,%201794-1874/1869%20Auguste%20Friederike%20baptism.md) of his daughter Auguste
* In 1871, at the [baptism](../sources/Germany,%20Prussia,%20Brandenburg%20and%20Posen,%20Church%20Book%20Duplicates,%201794-1874/1871%20Anna%20Ernestine%20Ulrike%20Zimmermann%20baptism.md) of his daughter Anna
* In 1871, at the [death](../sources/Germany,%20Prussia,%20Brandenburg%20and%20Posen,%20Church%20Book%20Duplicates,%201794-1874/1871%20Auguste%20Zimmermann%20death.md) of his daughter Auguste

The Zimmermann family history book suggests that he may have been an orphan; if this is the case, it's possible that his birth name is not known.

## Date of birth

His date of birth is uncertain.

Family records say 13 May 1841, but nothing has been found to corroborate that date.

A possible [christening record](../sources/Germany%20Births%20and%20Baptisms,%201558-1898/1841%20Carl%20August%20Wilhelm%20Zimmermann.md) puts his birth at 16 May 1841.

There is a possible [baptimal record match](../sources/Germany%20Births%20and%20Baptisms,%201558-1898/1841%20Ernst%20August%20Zimmermann.md) with the Prussian infantry.

He is recorded at 27yo when he was married on 15 Nov 1868, making his year of birth either 1841 or 1842.

He is recorded at 30yo in shipping records for the voyage that departed 1 Dec 1871.

## Parents

A possible [christening record](../sources/Germany%20Births%20and%20Baptisms,%201558-1898/1841%20Carl%20August%20Wilhelm%20Zimmermann.md) lists a father's name of "Friedr. Wilhelm Zimmermann" and mother's name of "Charlotte Caroline Reinecke."

Another possible [baptimal record match](../sources/Germany%20Births%20and%20Baptisms,%201558-1898/1841%20Ernst%20August%20Zimmermann.md) lists a father's name of "Ferdinand Zimmermann" and a mother's name of "Margaretha Senner" (in Aachen)

[Church records of his marriage](../sources/Germany,%20Prussia,%20Brandenburg%20and%20Posen,%20Church%20Book%20Duplicates,%201794-1874/1868%20August%20Friedrich%20Wilhelm%20Zimmermann%20marriage.md) list his father as `Christ Zimmermann`. Oddly enough, his wife's middle name is also recorded as `Christ` instead of Christine. Nothing was recorded about his mother.

## Religion

When he was married, he was listed as `Evangelische` in [church records](../sources/Germany,%20Prussia,%20Brandenburg%20and%20Posen,%20Church%20Book%20Duplicates,%201794-1874/1868%20August%20Friedrich%20Wilhelm%20Zimmermann%20marriage.md)

It seems he was a little naughty, given that he was married in Nov 1868 and his first child was born by June 1869.
