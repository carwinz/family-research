[Marriage record](../sources/Deutschland,%20ausgewählte%20evangelische%20Kirchenbücher%201500-1971/1871%20August%20Friedrich%20Zimmermann.md) and [another](../sources/Germany%20Marriages,%201558-1929/1871%20August%20Friedrich%20Zimmermann%20marriage.md).


This is a weird one. It's ~2 years after the other marriage. And Ernst is ~2 years older. And `Wilhelmine Christine` also matches. It's also the right area. What is her dad's name? It's in Prezlau. It's not long before they left for Australia.

I'm still backing Schulz as the right maiden name because the shipping records that included her sisters has them as Schulz.
